A Tic-tac-toe game, including step-by-step guide for how it was built.

If you are new to the MRE SDK, welcome! It's fun and (relatively)
easy to get started building your own MREs. But before you try to go 
through this tutorial, please first try to build and deploy the Hello 
World sample.

To go through the tutorial, look at the tutorial-steps folder. It 
contains a subfolder for each step, including the app.ts for that 
step, as well as a link to a side-by-side comparison of the folder
before and after the step.
